 * Problem-3 :- Is there a min-heap/max-heap with seven distinct elements so that the inorder
traversal of it gives the elements in sorted order?

Solution: No. Since a heap must be either a min-heap or a max-heap, the root will hold the
smallest element or the largest. An inorder traversal will visit the root of the tree as its second
step, which is not the appropriate place if the treeâ€™s root contains the smallest or largest element.
